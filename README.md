# Spring Boot Student CRUD

Welcome to the Spring Boot Student CRUD repository! In this project, we demonstrate the implementation of a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations system for managing student information. The application is built using the powerful Spring Boot framework, with a focus on the usage of JDBC Template for database interactions.

## Features

- **Spring Boot Framework:** Leverage the benefits of the Spring Boot framework for building robust and scalable Java applications.
- **JDBC Template:** Explore the use of JDBC Template for efficient and simplified database operations, allowing seamless interaction with the underlying database.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage student records in the system.
- **RESTful API:** Expose RESTful endpoints to interact with the application, making it easy to integrate with other services or front-end applications.
- **Exception Handling:** Learn how to handle exceptions gracefully within a Spring Boot application for a smooth user experience.

## Usage
- Use the exposed API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on student records.
- Refer to the codebase and inline comments for a detailed understanding of the implementation.
- Customize and extend the project based on your specific requirements.
